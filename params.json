[ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net/) Web API is an ideal platform for building [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) applications on the .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n[More on the official ASP.NET Microsoft Documentation Website](https://www.asp.net/web-api)\r\n\r\n##What is MVC?\r\n\r\nModel-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architecture - the structure of the system - that separates domain/application/business (whatever you prefer) logic from the rest of the user interface. It does this by separating the application into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller.\r\n\r\nThe model manages fundamental behaviors and data of the application. It can respond to requests for information, respond to instructions to change the state of its information, and even to notify observers in event-driven systems when information changes. This could be a database, or any number of data structures or storage systems. In short, it is the data and data-management of the application.\r\n\r\nThe view effectively provides the user interface element of the application. It'll render data from the model into a form that is suitable for the user interface.\r\n\r\nThe controller receives user input and makes calls to model objects and the view to perform appropriate actions.\r\n\r\nAll in all, these three components work together to create the three basic components of MVC.\r\n\r\n##What is SendGrid?\r\n\r\nSendGrid is a transactional email delivery and management service. Basically, its API allows you to send automated emails to a large number of clients, and these types of services are behind most of the mail you receive from online stores, social media websites and so forth.\r\n\r\n##Let's get started\r\n\r\nAs I said, we will be starting from scratch, so we need to fire up [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and create a new project. Select ASP.NET Web Application under the Visual C#'s Web tab. Next, we select Web API and tick the checkboxes for MVC and Web API under `Add folders and core references for:`. What  this does is that it creates a template for the project, adding the folders and references for a MVC based project. Now we should be all set-up to start writing some code.\r\n\r\n##Creating the Model\r\n\r\nThe model is the bread and butter of our application. What it does is that it manages the data, logic and rules of our application. For this demo, we won't be going too much in depth with this concept, because the model we need for our mail-spamming machine is a very basic one. Remember that we ticked that MVC checkbox when we created the project? Well, now we should be able to see a `Models` folder in our solution explorer. We will create our model there, so create a new class in that folder and we will name it `EmailData`.\r\nDue to the fact that we do not need a complicated model, we can just go with a few properties that we need in order to send our mail:\r\n\r\n    public class EmailData\r\n        {\r\n            public string ToEmailAddress { get; set; }\r\n            public string FromEmailAddress { get; set; }\r\n            public string Content { get; set; }\r\n            public string Subject { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThis is our model. We need a ToEmailAddress so we know where to send the mail, a FromEmailAddress so the person receiving it knows where it comes from, the Content of the mail and a Subject.\r\n\r\n##Integrating SendGrid API\r\n\r\nTo install SendGrid, run the following command in the [Package Manager Console](https://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/tools/package-manager-console): `Install-Package Sendgrid`. Next, we need a class that will act as a 'Sender' for our email and for that we will create a new folder called `Senders` since it does not belong in any of the folders that we already have. Inside of that folder we will create our `EmailSender` class called just like that, and we will use the API integration from [SendGrid's official library](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp) and adapt it to our model.\r\n\r\nSo, this is our class:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    using SendGrid;\r\n    using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;\r\n    using System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n    \r\n    namespace Example\r\n    {\r\n        internal class Example\r\n        {\r\n            private static void Main()\r\n            {\r\n                Execute().Wait();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public static async Task SendMail(EmailData emailData)\r\n            {\r\n                string apiKey = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\";\r\n                var sg = new SendGridAPIClient(apiKey);\r\n    \r\n                Email from = new Email(emailData.FromName);\r\n                string subject = emailData.Subject;\r\n                Email to = new Email(emailData.EmailAddress);\r\n                Content content = new Content(\"text/plain\", emailData.Content);\r\n                Mail mail = new Mail(from, subject, to, content);\r\n\r\n                var response = await sg.client.mail.send.post(requestBody: mail.Get());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n",
