[ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net/) Web API is an ideal platform for building [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) applications on the .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n[More on the official ASP.NET Microsoft Documentation Website](https://www.asp.net/web-api)\r\n\r\n##What is MVC?\r\n\r\nModel-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architecture - the structure of the system - that separates domain/application/business (whatever you prefer) logic from the rest of the user interface. It does this by separating the application into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller.\r\n\r\nThe model manages fundamental behaviors and data of the application. It can respond to requests for information, respond to instructions to change the state of its information, and even to notify observers in event-driven systems when information changes. This could be a database, or any number of data structures or storage systems. In short, it is the data and data-management of the application.\r\n\r\nThe view effectively provides the user interface element of the application. It'll render data from the model into a form that is suitable for the user interface.\r\n\r\nThe controller receives user input and makes calls to model objects and the view to perform appropriate actions.\r\n\r\nAll in all, these three components work together to create the three basic components of MVC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
